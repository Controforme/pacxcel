# pacxcel

A pac-man inspired game where you have to escape from genAI icons to do your freaking job in a spreadsheet editor.

Code based on the awesome pacman tutorial by "CodingWith-Adam" -> https://github.com/CodingWith-Adam/pacman

All the rants, in-game text, graphics and code errors added are mine.
